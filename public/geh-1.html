				<h1 class="projects-h1">Website Redesign: Gili Estlin Hirsch</h1>
				<p>This was the capstone project for my fall semester 2016 course with the IDM Program at MCAD, Web Design: Principles. The purpose of this project was to showcase the fundamental design principles such as typography, color theory, and grid-based design through the construction of a complete website. Students put together <a href="img/ogden_process_book.pdf">process books</a> demonstrating their individual progress as they developed and refined their sites throughout several weeks. For my project, I chose to redesign the existing website I had assembled for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GiliEstlinHirsch/">Gili Estlin Hirsch</a> in 2013.</p> 
				<p>One of my main concerns was that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503122215/http://giliestlinhirsch.com/">existing site</a> was not responsively designed and was difficult to read on a mobile device. After consulting with my client, Gili Estlin Hirsch, I created this new design that allows more whitespace, giving a more open feel to the site as a whole. The incorporation of drawings and photographs throughout the site reflects the author’s desire to combine words with images in her work. My primary aim in this project was to completely refurbish the existing Gili Estlin Hirsch website, recoding everything from the ground up, in order to provide a website for my client that more accurately reflects her personality and identity as an author and artist. </p>
