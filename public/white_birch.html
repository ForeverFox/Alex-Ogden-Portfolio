				<p>This was an assignment for my fall semester 2016 MCAD course, Web Development: HTML and CSS. Students were given a choice of webpages to redesign based on imagined client requirements. One of the options was to recreate the home page for White Birch Resort, a real business located in Hines, Minnesota. The original, existing design for White Birch Resort was given to students and we were to restructure as much information from that page as possible in our new design. The redesign was meant to resemble an Airbnb-type page with large images of the resort. The page was intended to be viewed across mobile devices, although for the assignment, this aspect only pertained to optimizing images for scale. We were also asked to include an embedded Google map on the page, as well as an extensive reservation form, as one of the main objectives of the lesson was to learn to create proper HTML forms. (The current <a href="https://www.whitebirchresort.net/">website</a> for White Birch Resort has since been redesigned and developed.)</p>
